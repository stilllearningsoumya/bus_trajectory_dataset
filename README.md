# Bus Trajectory Dataset
This dataset contains the bus trajectory dataset collected by 6 volunteers who were asked to travel across the sub-urban city of Durgapur, India, on intra-city buses (route name: 54 Feet). During the travel the volunteers captured sensor logs through an Android application installed on COTS smartphones. The details of the modalities logged by the Android application is given as follows.

## Known Issues with the Dataset
Some of the minor known probelms in the dataset are:
1. Some of the WiFi SSID(s) have characters replaced by unrecognised characters (or even emojis).
2. A suggested way of calculating the speed of the vehicle is by computing the difference in distance from the GPS coordinates and then checking the time taken to travel that distance. However, that would also include the stoppage time, if any.
